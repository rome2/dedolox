 * This class implements an exponential AHDSR envelope (Attack, Hold, Decay, Sustain, Release) with
 * a first order lowpass IIR filter. It is very similar to the way analog synths implement ADSR
 * envelopes (with RC circuits) so it is very analog sounding. The attack time, decay time, sustain
 * level and release time are all independently adjustable. Typical A, D and R time range from 1
 * millisecond to 20 (or more) seconds. Most synths have one EG for the VCA and one for the VCF. The
 * generated values are between 0.0 and 1.0.
